# GifTastic

* This aplication is searching for fun gifs by hitting the Giphy API and dinamically updating the page with your the button's search topic.
* Sports (e.g. Gymnastics, Football, Tennis) are used as featured topic.

### Usage

* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gifs animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

* The title of the gif appears on top of the gif and rating under the gif.

* There is an add button form to add new sport button to the page.

* The page has responsive design to be viewed on mobile devices too.
